            <h1>SpongeBob SquarePants</h1>
            <p>
              SpongeBob SquarePants is an American animated comedy television
              series created by marine science educator and animator Stephen
              Hillenburg for Nickelodeon. The series chronicles the adventures
              and endeavors of the title character and his aquatic friends in
              the fictional underwater city of Bikini Bottom. The
              fifth-longest-running American animated series, its popularity has
              made it a media franchise. It is the highest rated series to air
              on Nickelodeon and ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks' most
              distributed property. As of late 2017, the media franchise has
              generated $13 billion in merchandising revenue for Nickelodeon.

            <h2>Patrick & Bob</h2>
            <p>
              The next-door neighbors, Patrick Star have the closest
              relationship in the series. Though the two might not be the
              brightest bulbs in the socket, SpongeBob and Patrick are about as
              close as best friends get, though most of the time their wacky
              antics only serve to land them in deep water without even trying.
              Though the two are inseparable almost every waking moment, there
              have been times where the two have not been the closest buds. The
              list mentioned below is for the number of times the two have
              fought.

              The Krusty Krab is a fictional fast food restaurant in the
              American animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants. The
              restaurant was founded by Eugene H. Krabs (Mr. Krabs), who is also
              the owner and manager. It has two full-time employees: SpongeBob
              SquarePants, who works as the fry cook; and Squidward Tentacles,
              who works as the cashier. The Krusty Krab is deemed "the finest
              eating establishment ever established for eating" in Bikini
              Bottom.
